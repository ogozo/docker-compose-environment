An event-driven, fully observable e-commerce microservice platform simulation, designed to tackle the core engineering challenges of large-scale systems.

## üìñ Overview

This project is designed to solve the fundamental engineering challenges faced by large-scale e-commerce platforms, such as distributed data consistency, service independence, performance, and observability. The system manages the core user flow from registration and adding items to a cart to placing an order through microservices, each with its own distinct responsibility and database.

At the heart of the project lie the **Saga Pattern** and an **Event-Driven Architecture**, which reliably manage transactions across services in an asynchronous manner.

## üöÄ Architecture

The system consists of 5 main microservices, each with a single responsibility, designed to be independently developed and deployed. These services are supported by a robust infrastructure stack. The entire platform can be launched with a single `docker-compose up` command.

### Core Architectural Patterns

*   **Saga Pattern:** Manages distributed transactions that involve multiple services (like a `checkout` process) through a sequence of local transactions, where each service publishes an event upon completion. This ensures "eventual consistency" across the system.
*   **Polyglot Persistence:** The most suitable database technology is chosen for each workload: **PostgreSQL** for structured data, **Couchbase** for flexible cart data, and **Redis** for high-speed caching.
*   **Full-Stack Observability:** The system is fully integrated with the three pillars of modern observability: **Traces** (Jaeger), **Metrics** (Prometheus/Grafana), and **Logs** (EFK Stack).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Running

This repository contains the central configuration files to launch the entire project's infrastructure and Go services with a single command.

### Prerequisites

*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
*   [Go (v1.22+)](https://golang.org/doc/install)
*   All microservice repositories must be cloned at the same directory level as this repository.

    ```
    /e-commerce-project
    |-- /api-gateway
    |-- /service-user
    |-- /service-product
    |-- /service-cart
    |-- /service-order
    |-- /proto-definitions
    |-- /docker-compose-environment  <-- (You are here)
    ```

### Running the Platform

1.  Navigate to the `docker-compose-environment` directory in your terminal.
2.  Run the following command to build and start the entire system in the background:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
3.  To stop the system:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
4.  To stop the system and remove all data volumes (databases, logs, etc.):
    ```bash
    docker-compose down -v
    ```

## üì° API Endpoints

The main API endpoints are served by the `api-gateway` service. For a detailed list, please refer to the `README.md` file in the `api-gateway` repository. Some core endpoints include:

*   **User:** `POST /api/v1/register`, `POST /api/v1/login`
*   **Product:** `GET /api/v1/products/:id`
*   **Cart:** `GET /api/v1/cart`, `POST /api/v1/cart/items`
*   **Order:** `POST /api/v1/checkout`

## üî≠ Observability

Once the system is running, you can monitor the platform's status through the following interfaces:

*   **Jaeger (Traces):** [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686)
*   **Prometheus (Metrics):** [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
*   **Grafana (Dashboards):** [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
    *   After adding Prometheus as a data source, you can import the dashboard with ID **14331**.
*   **Kibana (Logs):** [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)
    *   You can discover all logs by creating a "data view" with the index `ecommerce-logs-*`.
